## Solution Approach


## Installation
Clone this repository: git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd backend
Install the required packages: node install
Usage
To run the nodejs app, use the following command:

- node start
The API endpoints for fetching and pushing data are:

- GET /airport/ ->Return list of all airports with codenames & coordinates.
- GET /weather/:airport_id   ->Return weather conditions for the particular airport.
- GET /flight_route/    ->Return list of all flight routes with haverian distance and details such as coordinate of airports connected.
- GET /flight_route/get_shortest_route/:source_airport_id/to/:destination_airport_id -> Return shortest path routes from source airport to destination airport.
- The data is assumed to be forecasted data and real-time data entered by the user.

## Database Schema
The database schema for this project is designed to be in the 2nd Normal Form (2NF). It consists of three tables:

- Flights Collection
- Weather Collection
- Airports Collection
- Alerts Collection
- Shortest Path Collection
- Harvesian Distance Collection

## Limitations and Future Work
- This project is still in its early stages and has some limitations. For example, the database could be further optimized to reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

- In the future, we plan to add support for JWT authentication and authorization. We also plan to integrate the front-end ReactJS application with the API to create a complete solution for the real-time updates for the project.
